Simple video playback / video capture using EmguCV in VVVV
Options are open for full replacement of DirectShow, including spreadable video, CV manipulation, access to images in dynamic plugins, CV in dynamic plugins

EmguCV is dual license (GPL/commercial). So this code is GPL, and you should be wary that also your code must be GPL if it employs this.
Suggest move to opencvsharp http://code.google.com/p/opencvsharp/
or discussion with EmguCV about a licensing model for the VVVV community.

Ensure that all the OpenGL dll's + Emgu.CV.dll and Emgu.Util.dll are in your plugin folder. Also note that the location of your plugin folder needs to be set if you're using vvvv26+. Check Prerequisites.zip
